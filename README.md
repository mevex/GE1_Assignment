## Description
The project consists of a "The Binding of Isaac" dungeon style generator. Basically, the dungeon will be made out of tile-based rooms that are going to be procedurally generated using multiple layers of Perlin noise for the floor and the obstacles inside the room.
There will also be enemies with different behaviours and simple AI.
